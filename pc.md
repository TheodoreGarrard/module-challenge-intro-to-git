## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? 
A Version control System
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is the version control system, while Github is essentially cloud based storage/hosting.
3. Why do we create a branch?
We create branches to easily track changes made to projects, who made them, and any bugs that could result from the changes.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
A pull request is to have peers review and discuss changes, and for additional changes before its merged into the main branch.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
In this example- git checkout main -will switch to the main branch.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
Git fetch lets you see what others have been working on, without merging the changes into your local repo. Git merge merges two branches together, and Git pull does the same thing as fetch, but also updates your local file.
7. What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when there are differences in code during a merge of two commits.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
You have to do so manually through a text editor, then add, or commit the change.
